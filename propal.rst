Current position
****************

*Please provide here any relevant information about your current position and your organization*

Serge Guelton is an open source developer leading the Pythran project on his personal time. He’s also a compiler egineer and an occasional computer-science lecturer.

Diploma
*******

*Tell us more about your academic background: highlight here the most important steps and achievements*

Serge Guelton holds a compiler engineer degree from Télécom Bretagne, with a specialisation in Computer Science, and a PhD in Computer Science with a focus on compilation and heterogeneous computing.

Professional curriculum
***********************

*If applicable, tell us more about your professional background: highlight here the main roles and positions you might have had.*

Throughout is career, Serge Guelton has been employed by INRIA as an engineer on distributed computing, by three strat-ups as a research engineer in distributed computing and compilation: at Quiet Oceans were he implemented a distributed ocean noise simulator; at HPC Project were he contributed to an auto-parallelizing compiler and at QuarksLab were he led the construction of an LLVM-based obfuscator. He is an active contributor of the LLVM project. In parallel to his professional career, Serge Guelton has been developing the Pythran project as an open source personal project, building a user community, publishing academic and technical papers and presenting his project in international conferences.

Skills
******

*Tell us more here about your skills in relation to the submission*

The Pythran project embodies the will of merging academic and engineering skills in one tool: To touch a large community, good engineering practices, with a focus on usability and deployment are required. To achieve peak performance and compete with traditional compiled code, a good knowledge of hardware constraints is needed. To build a bridge between the high-level modelling of a problem provided by the Python description and the low-level description necessary to the HPC field, firm academic grounds is a core requirement.

Further information
*******************

*Provide here any other relevant information: award, patent, collaboration, teaching, mentoring, etc.*

The activities of Serge Guelton around the Pythran project have led to a rich set of interactions with educational, academic and industrial world. He has mentored several third-years student of Télécom Bretagne on various compilation-related aspects of Pythran (Alan Raynaud, Adrien Merlini et Éliott Coyac). He has been presenting his ideas at Super Computing Workshops, at the Scipy Conference and in the regular French Compilation meetings. The result of his work on Pythran is now regularly used worldwide by both engineers, PhD students and researchers (more than 16k downloads on https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pythran, more than 6k downloads per months on https://pypistats.org/packages/pythran). It is used at Facebook to speedup some computational pipelines, at UAudio to accelerate the prototype-to-product pipeline (see http://serge-sans-paille.github.io/pythran-stories/pythran-as-a-bridge-between-fast-prototyping-and-code-deployment.html), an in financial firms to speedup simulation. It is a component of the https://opendreamkit.org/ european project, in the performance WP.
